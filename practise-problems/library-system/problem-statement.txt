Problem Statement: Library Management System


You are tasked with designing a Library Management System using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in
Python. The system should manage books, users, and borrowing operations. Use abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance
, and polymorphism to implement the solution

Requirements

Books:

Each book has:
title
author
ISBN
copies_available
Implement a way to display book details and update the number of available copies.
Users:

There are two types of users:
Member: Can borrow books.
Librarian: Can add or remove books.
Common attributes for all users:
user_id
name
Use polymorphism to define roles and actions for Member and Librarian.
Borrowing Operations:

A member can:
Borrow a book if copies are available.
Return a book to increase available copies.
If no copies are available, the system should notify the user.
Encapsulation:

Protect the attributes like copies_available to prevent direct modification. Use getters and setters.
Abstraction:

Define an abstract class User that enforces a role_description method for all user types.
